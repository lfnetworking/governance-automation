# Classification thresholds for LFN Project Governance
# This file defines the datapoints and thresholds used in the 'classify' job
# to assign each repository to one of the seven lifecycle phases.

phases:
  spark:
    # Spark: very early or inactive projects
    contributors:
      max: 2          # fewer than 3 unique contributors
    hasRelease: false # no releases present

  incubation:
    # Incubation: some traction but still early
    contributors:
      min: 3          # at least 3 unique contributors
    hasRelease: true  # at least one release
    # no additional velocity requirement

  active:
    # Active Development: high velocity and recent activity
    commits90d:
      min: 20         # at least 20 commits in last 90 days
    silentDays:
      max: 30         # last push within 30 days

  stable:
    # Stable: healthy but less intense than Active
    silentDays:
      min: 31         # no commits in last 30 days
      max: 180        # last push within 180 days

  maintenance_lts:
    # Maintenance / LTS: mature, low activity but maintained
    ageYrs:
      min: 5          # project has existed for at least 5 years
    silentDays:
      min: 181        # no commits in last 180 days
      max: 540        # last push within 540 days (~18 months)
    lastRelDays:
      max: 730        # has released within the last 2 years

  archive:
    # Archive: explicitly marked archived in GitHub
    archived: true

  inaccessible:
    # Inaccessible: private, moved, or error fetching metadata
    reachable: false

# Additional metrics for future enhancements or deeper insights:
#  These are not yet wired into the workflow logic but can be added as needed.
